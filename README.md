This project was created for a course that is offered at California State University Bakersfield, as a Senior Project. 
The purpose of the website is to implement a trade system that is similar to the many fantasy sports leagues that allow users the ability to create teams, trade players, look at current player statistics and their value to their current teams.
Any user can create an account and start trading players and looking at statistics of the current year, "2023".
